glycospectrumscan
=================

GlycoSpectrumScan is a web-based bioinformatic tool designed to link glycomics and proteomics analyses for the characterization of glycopeptides. It is MS-platform independent, freely accessible, and profiles glycopeptide MS data using beforehand separately acquired released glycan and proteomics information. Both N- and O-glycosylated peptides as well as multiply glycosylated peptides can be analyzed. It has been successfully applied and tested on the human colostrum sIgA glycoprotein complex.

Updates

We are busy migrating GlycoSpectrumScan to a new Java framework. Please contact the original developers and owners of the above if you would like to contribute to our efforts.
